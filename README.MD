# Basic Informational Site
This is my take on the Basic Informational Site project from The Odin Project, NodeJS course.

## The objective
To create a basic site that contains some pages and deliver a 404 page when an user tries to reach an inexistent page.
The focus is on serving and routing using NodeJS.
